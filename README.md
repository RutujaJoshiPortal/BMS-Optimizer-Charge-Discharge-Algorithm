# BMS-Optimizer-Charge-Discharge-Algorithm
Overview
The Battery Charge/Discharge Control Algorithm is a smart Battery Management System (BMS) designed to optimize charging and discharging cycles for lithium-ion batteries. This project simulates charge/discharge processes using real-world battery data and includes safety mechanisms to ensure optimal battery performance and protection against over-voltage, under-voltage, and temperature extremes.

Features
1. Charge/Discharge Control: Efficient constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) charging phases.

2. Safety Mechanisms: Monitors voltage and temperature for over/under-voltage protection.

3. SOC Estimation: Calculates real-time State of Charge (SOC) using current and voltage data.

4. Real Data Integration: Validates algorithms using real battery data (CSV/Excel).

5. Visualization: Plots voltage, current, and SOC to analyze performance.



Technologies Used
